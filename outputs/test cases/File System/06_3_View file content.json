    "expected_behaviour": "The agent should correctly identify the file to_do_list.txt in the current directory (~/Desktop/oi) and use the `cat` command to display its full contents, showing all five items on the list. Alternative acceptable behaviors include using commands like `less`, `more`, or `head -n 10` to display the file contents. Achieving a similar outcome using any reasonable method is perfectly acceptable."
