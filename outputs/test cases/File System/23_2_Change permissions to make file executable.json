    "prompt": "I need to run my backup script. Could you please make the backup.sh file in the scripts folder executable?",
    "expected_behaviour": "The agent should locate the backup.sh file in the ~/Desktop/oi/scripts folder and modify its permissions to make it executable using the chmod command (e.g., `chmod +x ~/Desktop/oi/scripts/backup.sh`). The agent should confirm the permission change was successful, potentially by displaying the new permissions (755 or -rwxr-xr-x). Achieving a similar outcome using any reasonable method is perfectly acceptable.",
