    "expected_behaviour": "The agent should execute the info.sh script and capture its complete output. It should present all sections of the generated report (date, hostname, user, disk usage, memory usage) with proper formatting preserved. The agent should indicate that the script executed successfully and display the entire output without omission. The information displayed should reflect the actual system state (real values for disk usage, memory usage, etc.) at the time of execution.",
