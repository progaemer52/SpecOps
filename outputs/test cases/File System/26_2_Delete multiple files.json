    "expected_behaviour": "The agent should identify all files with .log extension in ~/Desktop/oi/project/temp, delete only these log files using an appropriate command (such as navigating to the directory and using `rm *.log`), and confirm the deletion. The config.json and notes.txt files should remain untouched. Achieving a similar outcome using any reasonable method is perfectly acceptable.",
